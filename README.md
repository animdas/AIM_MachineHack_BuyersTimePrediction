# AIM MachineHack Hackathon - Buyers' Time Prediction Challenge 


### Problem Statement & Description
In this hackathon, the goal is to create a machine learning model to forecast the time spent by a buyer on an eCommerce platform. It is believed that AI and ML technologies hold significant promise in not only to predict buyersâ€™ time on a platform but also for customer segmentation as well as product recommendation.

The dataset for training has 5429 rows with nine columns, including time_spent column as the target variable. Alongside the dataset for testing includes 2327 rows with eight columns. The attribute description includes 
- session identifier (session_id and session_number); 
- client software and device details (client_agent and device_details); 
- date stamp of the session; 
- binary value for any purchase done, cart activity and check-out activity; and 
- the total time spent in seconds. 

The hackathon comes with a few prerequisite skills such as regression modelling, advanced feature engineering, and ability to optimise RMSLE score, on which the evaluation of the hackathon was done.


### Tools/Techniques used: 
Python, Data Visualization using Seaborn, Feature Engineering, Boosting Regressor Algorithms, Hyperparameter Optimization, Voting Regressor Ensemble.


### Result: 
Top 10% - Rank 79 / 793
